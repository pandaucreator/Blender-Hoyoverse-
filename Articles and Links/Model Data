If you're trying to find these pages in the future, check the bilibili activity list page found here;

https://www.bilibili.com/blackboard/activity-list.html?

 
If it ever moves or something, I found the activity page like this - on one of the old release pages, in the top left is the dropdown "首页" or "Front Page", hovered it and found the "活动" option or "Activity", 
it's icon currently is an orange flag with the bilibli logo on it, and that's the activity history for bilibili "blackboard/era" posts.
